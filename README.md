# The Passive Investor

Theories and research about the stock market have stated that the semi-strong form of market efficiency seems to hold. This means that all public information is accurately reflected in the price of an financial instrument. This makes the job of a portfolio manager primarily managing the desired risk appetite of the client and not explicitly trying to outperform the market. This fact in combination with Finance professionals all around the world looking for that 'edge' to make their investment decisions as profitable as possible, makes it so the average joe can not compete.

Therefore, the term 'Passive Investing' is often coined around. This often refers to buying ETFs that follow the index (i.e. S&P 500, Dow Jones Index) or a broad market (Developed Markets, MSCI World) for diversification benefits. This means that a sudden decrease in performance of one stock within the index does not (on average) lead to a significant decline in the index as a whole. This also allows the holder to spend limited time monitoring his holdings, therefore the term 'Passive'.

With a large increase in ETFs available (over 5,000 in 2020), it can become difficult to make the right choice in what ETFs you wish to invest. There are many different providers offering ETFs (iShares, Vanguard, Invesco) as well as with changes to the underlying stocks (i.e. High Yield, Super Dividends, Equal Weighted). This is quickly reflected when looking for a S&P 500 ETF as there are over 20 different ETFs available.

With this program and the accompanying spreadhseet, I wish to make investment decisions easier to make and manage.
